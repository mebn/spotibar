## What it is
Spotibar is a small application that lives in your menu bar. It makes the media keys control Spotify no matter what application is in focus (and currently playing media).

### Example
Imagine you're listen to music while programming. You look up a tutorial for something on youtube but your music is still playing. You press the pause button on your keyboard but now the video pauses, not the music! With spotibar, spotify music will pause instead.

## How to install
Follow these steps to install `spotibar.app`. The app should work (although not tested) on both intel and m1 macs.

1. Go to [releases](https://github.com/mebn/spotibar/releases/latest) and download `spotibar.app.zip`
1. Open/unzip `spotibar.app.zip`
1. Drag `spotibar.app` to your applications folder
1. Open `settings.app` -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility and toggle spotibar.app
1. Open `spotibar.app` and have fun!

### How to add as login item
If you want `spotibar.app` to open on login, follow these steps:

1. Go to `settings.app`
1. Users & Groups -> Login Items
1. Click the `+` and select `spotibar.app`
