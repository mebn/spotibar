## What is it
Spotibar is a small application that lives in your menu bar. It makes the media keys control Spotify no matter what application is in focus (and currently playing media).

### Use case example
Imagine you're listen to music while programming. You look up a tutorial for something on youtube but your music is still playing. You press the pause button on your keyboard but now the video pauses, not the music! With spotibar, spotify music will pause instead.
